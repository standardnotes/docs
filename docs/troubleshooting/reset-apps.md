If you’re experiencing issues with signing into the apps, you may want to clear the app’s storage. Before proceeding, please sign into the [web](https://app.standardnotes.org) app (in a different browser, if needed) to confirm that notes, tags, and other items on your notes syncing account that were modified or created on another device are saved and synced to our servers.

**Warning**: If you do not have an account, do not proceed with these steps until a fix has been made available. You may have some luck in simply entering in your password or passcode several times until the app unlocks, as one user has reported that helping them across different apps.

## Mobile

**Please note**: Reinstalling the app on mobile devices will often download a backup of your app from the cloud and you’ll run into the same issue(s) again. Clearing the cache will not help, either.

### [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.standardnotes&hl=en_US)

1.  Locate the app in the app drawer
2.  Press & hold the app’s icon until a small menu appears
3.  Tap on **App Info**
4.  Locate the option to clear the app’s storage (and cache)
5.  Relaunch the app and sign in again

### [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/standard-notes/id1285392450)

1.  Please open the **Settings** app, and navigate to your iCloud backups with the following path:

    `[Your name and iCloud account username (at the top)] → iCloud → Manage Storage → Backups → [Name of the desired device]`

2.  Wait for the list of apps to load 

    2a. Tap on **Load all/more apps** and wait for the list to expand once more

3.  Finally, locate the Standard Notes app and tap on the toggle button to delete the current backup of the app and its storage from iCloud

4.  Please reinstall the app and sign in again

    4a. Optionally, you can enable the setting to back up the app and its storage to iCloud again
